<img src="https://i.ibb.co/4RwZnmZ/image.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>

Open your console/terminal and run this: 

```sh
cd Desktop #or: >cd </your/desired/project/path/> 
git clone https://github.com/cvera08/automation-frontend-playwright-typescript-github-actions.git
cd automation-frontend-playwright-typescript-github-actions
npm ci #or: >npm i

___

## [![](https://i.ibb.co/2kHmnLX/image.png)](#run-tests-in-uigui-mode)Run tests in UI/GUI mode
By using your console/terminal, make sure you are on the right path and run this:
```sh
#if you are not already there: >cd </your/desired/project/path>/automation-frontend-playwright-typescript-github-actions
npx playwright test --ui
```

<br/>

After this:
- You may be redirected to a Chromium Playwright runner,
- Click on the green play/run button to start running your tests,
   - Or hit the play/run button on your desired specific test,
- After you click on one or the other, Playwright will start automatically the execution and after a while, you will see the output results.

<sub> *// Please remember you have the full ability to run your tests on any desired browser, like chromium, firefox, webkit. Just click on the arrow at the left of the "Filter (e.g. text, @tag)" option to see more alternatives. Chromium is the default one.*</sub>

<sub>*// You may not want to use the Status (passed, failed, skipped) filter/check boxes before executing some tests, otherwise you will not see your tests anymore (since they were not executed yet).* </sub>

**Troubleshooting GUI mode:**  

_If you face some error you need to be sure you are in the base project folder (automation-frontend-playwright-typescript-github-actions) and run 'the following command' again (make sure not to have errors or fix them according to the printed help)_.
>npm install

If it still does not work, try restarting all the involved programs (like Playwright/IDE/etc), even your computer if it is necessary and start over again.

<sub> *// HINTS:*  
*- If the Playwright window becomes unresponsive for some reason try switching to another application/program and come back.*  
*- If you click in your Playwright runner and open a new empty window, just close it and next time try switching with your TAB key instead.* </sub>

Try running this:

```sh
#if you are not already there: >cd </your/desired/project/path>/automation-frontend-playwright-typescript-github-actions
npx playwright test
```

You will get something like this:  

![image](https://github.com/cvera08/automation-frontend-playwright-typescript-github-actions/assets/28716586/09e2e1b6-31a2-4d5f-8f5b-81740921be1e)

To open the last html report:

```sh
npx playwright show-report
#A similar output will be displayed: Serving HTML report at http://localhost:9323. 
##Press Ctrl+C to quit.

## [![](https://i.ibb.co/2kHmnLX/image.png)](#github-actions-support)GitHub Actions Support

This repository has the support for its own [GHA](https://github.com/cvera08/automation-frontend-playwright-typescript-github-actions/actions) as well

#### Run Tests with GHA

You can go to this repository > Actions Tab > Playwright Tests option at the left.  
Or just use this direct [Link](https://github.com/cvera08/automation-frontend-playwright-typescript-github-actions/actions/workflows/playwright.yml).

Once you are in the GitHub Actions for Playwright Tests you can hit the "Run workflow" button, select the desired branch to run your tests and click on the "Run workflow" green button.  
Your tests will automatically start to run and after a while, you may see the results for it.

![image](https://github.com/cvera08/automation-frontend-playwright-typescript-github-actions/assets/28716586/b1f9baec-2c81-4c02-ad69-f45218ca8ed0)

![image](https://github.com/cvera08/automation-frontend-playwright-typescript-github-actions/assets/28716586/1997e544-23b1-4322-a2c2-0533d22ac097)

<br/>

Feel free to download the playwright html report from the main execution page:

![image](https://github.com/cvera08/automation-frontend-playwright-typescript-github-actions/assets/28716586/2f1a447f-f72c-4102-a172-b0781291f500)


#### Test, Can I Deploy?, Deploy

As in the previous [Run Tests with GHA](#run-tests-with-gha) section, you can use the Actions tab > "Call Makefile Dispatch" left option.
Or just use this direct [Link](https://github.com/cvera08/automation-frontend-playwright-typescript-github-actions/actions/workflows/call_makefile_dispatch.yml).

Once there you can run the workflow manually (like in the previous steps) and you will be able to see one of these two scenarios:

![image](https://github.com/cvera08/automation-frontend-playwright-typescript-github-actions/assets/28716586/9d288019-2e4c-4897-a08a-6b5cccd663c6)

![image](https://github.com/cvera08/automation-frontend-playwright-typescript-github-actions/assets/28716586/b2b71a0f-785e-46f0-966b-fbbcdeb3918a)

For the second scenario we can see that the *deploy is being stopped* since the failing test/s ðŸ‘†.
