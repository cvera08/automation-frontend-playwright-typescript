<img src="https://i.ibb.co/4RwZnmZ/image.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>

Open your console/terminal and run this: 

```sh
cd Desktop #or: >cd </your/desired/project/path/> 
git clone https://github.com/cvera08/automation-frontend-playwright-typescript-github-actions.git
cd automation-frontend-playwright-typescript-github-actions
npm ci #or: >npm i
```

[Please follow to this section â–¼](#run-tests-in-headless-mode-with-option-for-html-report-visualization)
___

## [![](https://i.ibb.co/2kHmnLX/image.png)](#run-tests-in-uigui-mode)Run tests in UI/GUI mode
By using your console/terminal, make sure you are on the right path and run this:
```sh
#if you are not already there: >cd </your/desired/project/path>/automation-frontend-playwright-typescript-github-actions
npx playwright test --ui
```

<br/>

After this:
- You may be redirected to a Chromium Playwright runner,
- Click on the green play/run button to start running your tests,
   - Or hit the play/run button on your desired specific test,
- After you click on one or the other, Playwright will start automatically the execution and after a while, you will see the output results.

<sub> *// Please remember you have the full ability to run your tests on any desired browser, like chromium, firefox, webkit. Just click on the arrow at the left of the "Filter (e.g. text, @tag)" option to see more alternatives. Chromium is the default one.*</sub>

<sub>*// You may not want to use the Status (passed, failed, skipped) filter/check boxes before executing some tests, otherwise you will not see your tests anymore (since they were not executed yet).* </sub>

**Troubleshooting GUI mode:**  

_If you face some error you need to be sure you are in the base project folder (automation-frontend-playwright-typescript-github-actions) and run 'the following command' again (make sure not to have errors or fix them according to the printed help)_.
>npm install

If it still does not work, try restarting all the involved programs (like Playwright/IDE/etc), even your computer if it is necessary and start over again.

<sub> *// HINTS:*  
*- If the Playwright window becomes unresponsive for some reason try switching to another application/program and come back.*  
*- If you click in your Playwright runner and open a new empty window, just close it and next time try switching with your TAB key instead.* </sub>
